# SixGPT Miner [DEPRECATED]

This is the OLD version of the SixGPT miner. 
Our official miner is here: https://github.com/sixgpt/miner

# About

SixGPT is a decentralized synthetic data generation platform built on the Vana network. We empower users by giving them ownership of their data and enabling them to earn from it.

The SixGPT Miner is a software package which allows users to contribute data they generate for wikipedia question-answer based tasks to the network for rewards.
In the future, we will support other tasks such as chatbot conversations, image captioning, etc.

# Credentials

SixGPT uses two credentials to perform mining on Vana:

1. OpenAI api key, for access to the OpenAPI API
2. Google OAUTH, for storing your mined data in Google Drive.

# Install
